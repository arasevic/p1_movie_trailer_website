# p1_movie_trailer_website
This is my solution to the first project for the Full Stack Web Development Nano Degree on Udacity
The code is contained in 3 files: driver.py, movie_trailer_generator.py and movie.py
movie_trailer_generator.py takes an array of movies declared in the driver.py file and generatoes
the html that displays the names of each movie along with each movies poster. Once you click on each 
movie it will play the trailer for the movie. movies.py contains the class description for a movie
instance along with a single instance method.
