# p1_movie_trailer_website
This is my solution to the first project for the Full Stack Web Development Nano Degree on Udacity
The code is contained in 3 files: driver.py, movie_trailer_generator.py and movie.py
movie_trailer_generator.py takes an array of movies declared in the driver.py file and generatoes
the html that displays the names of each movie along with each movies poster. Once you click on each 
movie it will play the trailer for the movie. movies.py contains the class description for a movie
instance along with a single instance method.
To run the program from the command line run the following command:
python driver.py
Alternatively, if you open the file driver.py within the IDLE environment, just press the F5 button on
your keyboard or select "Run Module" from the Run menu option in IDLE.
